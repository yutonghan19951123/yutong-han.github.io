We can’t imagine, serious stomachache sent her nearly not eating anything for three days. After this show, she can’t stand anymore and was sent to the hospital.

Since that, her brain gradually became a three-year-old child’s brain. She can’t stand, has to be cared 24 hours per day. And it’s because of Thallium poisoning.

However, before the Thallium poisoning case, Zhu Ling is closed to a perfect “other people’s children”, which means the model children our parents often use them to criticize us. She not only is good at study, but also a versatile girl. Shen went to Tsinghua University to study physical chemistry.

She is the leader of the zither band in Tsinghua University. She is a national level two swimming athletes. Her English is very good. She was learning German when she was in college because she wanted to go to Germany after graduation.

Since the October in 1994, Zhu Ling suffered twice temporary loss of sight. She went to the school infirmary, but the doctors can’t find why. After that, she began to lose her hair, ache all over. She was better for a time, but gradually even worse.

At that time, she insisted to study in the dorm, because she is a tough girl, she wanted to graduate with two degrees, in physical chemistry and computer science. Even in the February in 1995, she was difficult to leave bed due to the great pain. She still studied in bed per day.

However, her old symptoms returned worse than before. she was sent to the hospital with the end of the concert. Frustrated with local physicians’ inability to help Zhu Ling, her friends Cai Quanqing and Bei Zhicheng, undergraduate students in Peking University, posted an “SOS” letter on a number of Internet usenet groups on April 10, 1995, describing their friend’s symptoms and asking for help with a diagnosis.

Of the more than 1,500 responses which Zhu Ling’s friends received, roughly one-third proposed that she was suffering from thallium poisoning, the common antidote for which is known as Prussian blue.
